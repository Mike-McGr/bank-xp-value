# RuneLite Banked XP plugin
Calculates the total amount of XP available in your bank and displays the data in a single, condensed overlay. To promote simplicity and ease of use, subjective factors such as level or preference are not taken into account -- XP rates for items are fixed to the most popular/"meta" use for them.
